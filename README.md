The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if a user enters ls then the shell executes the ls command. The shell can also execute other programs such as applications, scripts, and user programs (e.g., written in c or the shell programming language).
