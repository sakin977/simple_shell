.B hsh
[command] [options ...]

.SH COPYRIGHT

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a shell command interpreter that executes command read from the standard input or from file.

.B hsh
is intend to be a clone of the standard command interpreter of 

.B Unix
and 

.B Unix-like
system.

.SH OPTIONS
A  simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections, 
and terminated by a control operator.  The first word specifies the command to be
executed, and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.

.PP
The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.

.SS
Piplines
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:

.PP
[command [..ARGS]] [| - |&] [command2 [..ARGS]]

.PP
The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.  This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below).   If
|&  is  used,  command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.  This implicit redirection of the
standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command.
